The Team 6 wrapper applies `lstrip()` before first-line extraction for TREC,
TriviaQA and SAMSum instead of upstream `lstrip('\n')`. Metric functions are
unchanged. This policy is recorded as `longbench-v1-team6-leading-whitespace-v1`.
Scores are stored on a 0–100 scale. The team table uses the shared harness scorer
(0–1, rapidfuzz); do not mix scores from the two scorers.

LongBench data and pretrained model weights are external inputs and are not
included in the GitHub source distribution. Follow the relevant dataset and
model licenses when obtaining those inputs.
